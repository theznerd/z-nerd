## New Year, New Me (or some silly thing like that)
After four years (and a brief foray into hardware, which I will forever be grateful for)
I've hung up the HP Inc. hat. It was a tough decision - not because I'm not excited for
my next opportunity (far from it as I'll explain in a bit), but because I was truly
enjoying my time and the work we were progressing toward. Of course I can't share what
I was working on, but it was (and will be) IMHO exciting. I want to thank all of the
folks that I had the pleasure to work with at HP, and as I had mentioned in my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7429231454993383424/)
post, I'm especially thankful to the leadership team who gave a corporate device
manageability administrator a chance to play in the consumer space. To sum up my 
departure in a single sentence, let me say I'm not a fan of location strategies or 
return to office mandates. (Neither of which my direct manager had any control over, 
but sadly limited my opportunity to advance in my career in the long term) I truly see
the heart behind it even if I view it as misguided in the short-to-mid term, and a 
gamble at best for the long-term. However I did not get paid to have conversations at 
that level in the company so sadly my opinion did not hold any weight 🤣

The *good* news is that location strategy gave me the opportunity to consider another
position that I did not realize was in the realm of possibility. I'm excited to share
(if you didn't click the link above and hadn't already heard) that I'm joining the
team at [2Pint Software](https://2pintsoftware.com) as a principal engineer. It is
exciting to be back in the endpoint management space, and even more especially to be
back with coworkers from the job at Big Bank before my move to HP, as well as other
incredibly smart and talented folks. I'm excited to bring what I can to the table
amongst a team of absolute rock stars, and I'm excited to drink from the firehose
that is small company life.

This move should also bring me back into a place where PowerShell is more of a daily
language, and hopefully will mean that I have more opportunity to blog since it will
once again be relevant to my career. I'm hoping, but not promising to blog at least
once a week on Fridays.

## First Friday Post
I guess that means that today is as good as any for the first Friday post of my plan.
No time like the present. Since I didn't have anything planned going into today's
post other than sharing my news, and after having a conversation with another
PowerShell MVP... I think it's important for me to start spreading the good word
about the PowerShell Monthly Community Call.

> What? There's a community call?

You heard it here first apparently? As I mentioned to my MVP friend, I sometimes 
forget that not everyone peruses the [PowerShell GitHub](https://github.com/powershell)
for funsies. Additionally the information about the call is in a slightly odd place 
(PowerShell-RFC). You can read all about the call 
[here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/tree/master/CommunityCall). But
here's the skinny if you want to read before clicking a link?

1. The call takes place on the 3rd Thursday of every month
2. It's 30 minutes long and starts at 9:30am US Pacific
3. It's on Teams

Before the call there is a discussion post where the agenda is posted, and also you
can submit questions or even proposals for short demos (5 minutes, gong show style).
The goal is to have at least one community demo every month.

Also if you're interested in previous calls, they are archived to YouTube (links in
the above PowerShell-RFC repo) and a transcript of the call is placed in the notes
section of the same repo.

If you're in the PowerShell community at all, I encourage you to join the call.
You'll probably learn something new each month, or at least be informed of any 
upcoming changes to PowerShell and adjacent technologies (OpenSSH, DSCv3, and
anything else these friends own).

I've honestly rambled about this enough for the time being - click on the links
above, and I'll see you next month hopefullt! Don't be afraid to say "hi" in chat.

Happy Scripting!
