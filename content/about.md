Z-Nerd. It's a play on my last name (Ziehnert - ZEE-nert). I think people used this 
pejoratively more than once when I was a kid. The joke's on them I 
guess... because I've made a great career out of being a "nerd."

I've held a few different jobs over the years (analyst, engineer, consultant, software 
engineer) but they've all stayed in the realm of device managability. Throughout my career 
I've blogged a decent amount, but then I had kids. I tried to keep blogging, but by the third 
kid and another new job (actual work, not the kid) I was pretty tapped out. You can read all 
those posts in my ["archives."](https://archive.z-nerd.com/) I'll eventually bring over the 
posts that I think hold the most value as time allows, but I wanted a fresh start because 
nothing helps my executive dysfuction more than starting something new.

At the moment I'm an "Endpoint Management Software Engineer" for HP, Inc. I can't tell you much 
about what I do... I can't even tell my friends in other departments at HP what I do. NDAs and 
all that jazz. I wouldn't have to kill you if I told you, but unemployment benefits don't seem 
like a good way to provide for my family. From my title however, I'm sure you can guess that I 
have continued in the device managability space.

You'll find me from time to time speaking at [MEMUG](https://memug.org/) and 
[MMS](https://mmsmoa.com). If you've got a user group or conference and you need someone to 
kill an hour of time with stupid memes and some mild (or sometimes deep) technical content in 
Azure, PowerShell, Intune, or MEMCM/ConfigMgr, I'm a guy (not *THE* guy or even *YOUR* guy, but 
sometimes you gotta stick with what's available).

None of any of that matters.

Stick around to read some fun(ny?) stuff.

Eat Arby's.
