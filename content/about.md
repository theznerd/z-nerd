Z-Nerd. It's a play on my last name (Ziehnert - ZEE-nert). I think people used this 
pejoratively more than once when I was a kid. The joke's on them I guess... because
I've made a great career out of being a "nerd."

I've held a few different jobs over the years (analyst, engineer, consultant, software 
engineer) but they've all stayed in the realm of device managability... mostly. I did
take a brief detour in consumer notebooks for three years (still tangentally related
to manageability) and then a one year detour into hardware. Throughout my career I've 
blogged a decent amount (although less in my four year detour), but then I had kids. I 
tried to keep blogging, but by the third kid and another new job (actual work, not the
kid) I was pretty tapped out. You can read all those posts in my 
["archives."](https://archive.z-nerd.com/) I'll eventually bring over the posts that 
I think hold the most value as time allows, but I wanted a fresh start because nothing
helps my executive dysfuction more than starting something new.

At the moment (and hopefully for the rest of my career - at least company wise) I'm a 
"Principal Engineer" for [2Pint Software](https://2pintsoftware.com). We're buliding the
future of operating system deployments, device manageability, bandwidth management, and
more - check us out and feel free to hit me up with any questions you might have.

You'll find me from time to time speaking at user groups around the country (sadly MEMUG
shuttered its doors in 2024), and [MMS](https://mmsmoa.com). If you've got a user group
or conference and you need someone to kill an hour of time with stupid memes and some 
mild (or sometimes deep) technical content in PowerShell, I'm a guy (not *THE* guy or 
even *YOUR* guy, but sometimes you gotta stick with what's available).

None of any of that matters.

Stick around to read some fun(ny?) stuff.

Eat Arby's.
